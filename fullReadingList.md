Electronic Health Record Logs Indicate That Physicians Split Time Evenly Between Seeing Patients And Desktop Medicine.
Ming Tai-Seale, Cliff W Olson, Jinnan Li, Albert S Chan, Criss Morikawa, Meg Durbin, Wei Wang, and Harold S Luft.
Time spent by physicians is a key resource in health care delivery. This study used data captured by the access time stamp functionality of an electronic health record (EHR) to examine physician work effort. This is a potentially powerful, yet unobtrusive, way to study physicians' use of time. We used data on physicians' time allocation patterns captured by over thirty-one million EHR transactions in the period 2011-14 recorded by 471 primary care physicians, who collectively worked on 765,129 patients' EHRs. Our results suggest that the physicians logged an average of 3.08 hours on office visits and 3.17 hours on desktop medicine each day. Desktop medicine consists of activities such as communicating with patients through a secure patient portal, responding to patients' online requests for prescription refills or medical advice, ordering tests, sending staff messages, and reviewing test results. Over time, log records from physicians showed a decline in the time allocated to face-to-face visits, accompanied by an increase in time allocated to desktop medicine. Staffing and scheduling in the physician's office, as well as provider payment models for primary care practice, should account for these desktop medicine efforts.

Big data and new knowledge in medicine: the thinking, training, and tools needed for a learning health system.
Harlan M Krumholz.
Big data in medicine--massive quantities of health care data accumulating from patients and populations and the advanced analytics that can give those data meaning--hold the prospect of becoming an engine for the knowledge generation that is necessary to address the extensive unmet information needs of patients, clinicians, administrators, researchers, and health policy makers. This article explores the ways in which big data can be harnessed to advance prediction, performance, discovery, and comparative effectiveness research to address the complexity of patients, populations, and organizations. Incorporating big data and next-generation analytics into clinical and population health research and practice will require not only new data sources but also new thinking, training, and tools. Adequately utilized, these reservoirs of data can be a practically inexhaustible source of knowledge to fuel a learning health care system.

Creating value in health care through big data: opportunities and policy implications.
Joachim Roski, George W Bo-Linn, and Timothy A Andrews.
Big data has the potential to create significant value in health care by improving outcomes while lowering costs. Big data's defining features include the ability to handle massive data volume and variety at high velocity. New, flexible, and easily expandable information technology (IT) infrastructure, including so-called data lakes and cloud data storage and management solutions, make big-data analytics possible. However, most health IT systems still rely on data warehouse structures. Without the right IT infrastructure, analytic tools, visualization approaches, work flows, and interfaces, the insights provided by big data are likely to be limited. Big data's success in creating value in the health care sector may require changes in current polices to balance the potential societal benefits of big-data approaches and the protection of patients' confidentiality. Other policy implications of using big data are that many current practices and policies related to data use, access, sharing, privacy, and stewardship need to be revised.

<h3>Importance</h3><p>Deep learning is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior, removing the need to specify rules explicitly. Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs.</p><h3>Design and Setting</h3><p>A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency.</p><h3>Exposure</h3><p>Deep learning–trained algorithm.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3% (95% CI, 87.5%-92.7%) and the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 97.8%-98.5%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0% (95% CI, 81.1%-91.0%) and the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.1%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 93.4% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 93.9%.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.</p>

The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis.
David Lazer, Ryan Kennedy, Gary King, and Alessandro Vespignani.
In February 2013, Google Flu Trends (GFT) made headlines but not for a reason that Google executives or the creators of the flu tracking system would have hoped. Nature reported that GFT was predicting more than double the proportion of doctor visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which bases its estimates on surveillance reports from laboratories across the United States ( 1 , 2 ). This happened despite the fact that GFT was built to predict CDC reports. Given that GFT is often held up as an exemplary use of big data ( 3 , 4 ), what lessons can we draw from this error?

Implications of an emerging EHR monoculture for hospitals and healthcare systems.
Ross Koppel and Christoph U Lehmann.
In many hospitals and health systems, a 'new' electronic health record means a shift to one vendor: Epic, a vendor that dominates in large and medium hospital markets and continues its success with smaller institutions and ambulatory practices. Our paper examines the implications of this emerging monoculture: its advantages and disadvantages for physicians and hospitals and its role in innovation, professional autonomy, implementation difficulties, workflow, flexibility, cost, data standards, interoperability, and interactions with other information technology (IT) systems.

Using Electronic Health Records for Surgical Quality Improvement in the Era of Big Data.
Jamie E Anderson and David C Chang.
Importance:Risk adjustment is an important component of quality assessment in surgical health care. However, data collection places an additional burden on physicians. There is also concern that outcomes can be gamed depending on the information recorded for each patient.
Objective:To determine whether a number of machine-collected data elements could perform as well as a traditional full-risk adjustment model that includes other physician-assessed and physician-recorded data elements.
Design, Settings, and Participants:All general surgery patients from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010, were included. Separate multivariate logistic regressions were performed using either all 66 preoperative risk variables or only 25 objective variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each regression using objective preoperative risk variables was compared with its corresponding regression with all preoperative variables. Subset analyses were performed among patients who received certain operations.
Main Outcomes and Measures:Mortality or any surgical complication captured by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, both inpatient and within 30 days postoperatively.
Results:Data from a total of 745 053 patients were included. More than 15.8% of patients had at least 1 complication and the mortality rate was 2.8%. When examining inpatient mortality, the AUC was 0.9104 with all 66 variables vs 0.8918 with all 25 objective variables. The difference in AUC comparing models with all variables with objective variables ranged from -0.0073 to 0.1944 for mortality and 0.0198 to 0.0687 for complications. In models predicting mortality, the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, pancreatic resection, colectomy, and appendectomy. In models predicting complications, the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with pancreatic resection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colectomy, and appendectomy.
Conclusions and Relevance:Rigorous risk-adjusted surgical quality assessment can be performed solely with objective variables. By leveraging data already routinely collected for patient care, this approach allows for wider adoption of quality assessment systems in health care. Identifying data elements that can be automatically collected can make future improvements to surgical outcomes and quality analyses.

Big data in health care: using analytics to identify and manage high-risk and high-cost patients.
David W Bates, Suchi Saria, Lucila Ohno-Machado, Anand Shah, and Gabriel Escobar.
The US health care system is rapidly adopting electronic health records, which will dramatically increase the quantity of clinical data that are available electronically. Simultaneously, rapid progress has been made in clinical analytics--techniques for analyzing large quantities of data and gleaning new insights from that analysis--which is part of what is known as big data. As a result, there are unprecedented opportunities to use big data to reduce the costs of health care in the United States. We present six use cases--that is, key examples--where some of the clearest opportunities exist to reduce costs through the use of big data: high-cost patients, readmissions, triage, decompensation (when a patient's condition worsens), adverse events, and treatment optimization for diseases affecting multiple organ systems. We discuss the types of insights that are likely to emerge from clinical analytics, the types of data needed to obtain such insights, and the infrastructure--analytics, algorithms, registries, assessment scores, monitoring devices, and so forth--that organizations will need to perform the necessary analyses and to implement changes that will improve care while reducing costs. Our findings have policy implications for regulatory oversight, ways to address privacy concerns, and the support of research on analytics.

Although molecular prognostics in breast cancer are among the most successful examples of translating genomic analysis to clinical applications, optimal approaches to breast cancer clinical risk prediction remain controversial. The Sage Bionetworks-DREAM Breast Cancer Prognosis Challenge (BCC) is a crowdsourced research study for breast cancer prognostic modeling using genome-scale data. The BCC provided a community of data analysts with a common platform for data access and blinded evaluation of model accuracy in predicting breast cancer survival on the basis of gene expression data, copy number data, and clinical covariates. This approach offered the opportunity to assess whether a crowdsourced community Challenge would generate models of breast cancer prognosis commensurate with or exceeding current best-in-class approaches. The BCC comprised multiple rounds of blinded evaluations on held-out portions of data on 1981 patients, resulting in more than 1400 models submitted as open source code. Participants then retrained their models on the full data set of 1981 samples and submitted up to five models for validation in a newly generated data set of 184 breast cancer patients. Analysis of the BCC results suggests that the best-performing modeling strategy outperformed previously reported methods in blinded evaluations; model performance was consistent across several independent evaluations; and aggregating community-developed models achieved performance on par with the best-performing individual models.
