### "If I were going to open source..."
Red Hat has a [good site for explaining "open source"](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), and has built a [robust business](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:RHT) out of developing and supporting open source software. As a company, they have demonstrated that they can deliver enterprise-grade operating systems and other software that are as reliable, secure, and stable as typical "closed source" products from their competitors. Yet their source code is open and people are free to use Red Hat products, without charge, however they like.
