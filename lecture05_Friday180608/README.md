# Lecture 5 Laboratory in Version Control
___
This will be a team project focused on using version control to cooperatively compose and edit a document. The document should be on the subject "Interesting use cases for version control". If you Google the topic, you should be a variety of cases in which people have used version control for interesting projects, not necessarily for developing software. What I'd like your team to do is find such a use case and discuss/critique it. We will use this class time as a lab for getting familiar with using Git and Github with me and Ben Neely in the room so you can ask questions.

### Goals & Assignment
1. Each team should create a Project in Github 
2. As described in _van Strien_, create a plain text document and place it under version control, even better if you use Markdown, i.e. create a "*.md" file (see [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for Github-flavored markdown).
3. The document should have these sections:
  * Description of Use Case
  * Why is it a good use of version control (Git/Github)?
  * Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?
  * What would you do differently?
4. In performing each assignment some version control conditions have to be met:
  * Each member of a team must perform a 'commit'
  * Each member of a team must perform a 'pull request'
  * You must use a 'branch' for each section of the document
