Big data in health care: using analytics to identify and manage high-risk and high-cost patients.

David W Bates, Suchi Saria, Lucila Ohno-Machado, Anand Shah, and Gabriel Escobar.

The US health care system is rapidly adopting electronic health records, which will dramatically increase the quantity of clinical data that are available electronically. Simultaneously, rapid progress has been made in clinical analytics--techniques for analyzing large quantities of data and gleaning new insights from that analysis--which is part of what is known as big data. As a result, there are unprecedented opportunities to use big data to reduce the costs of health care in the United States. We present six use cases--that is, key examples--where some of the clearest opportunities exist to reduce costs through the use of big data: high-cost patients, readmissions, triage, decompensation (when a patient's condition worsens), adverse events, and treatment optimization for diseases affecting multiple organ systems. We discuss the types of insights that are likely to emerge from clinical analytics, the types of data needed to obtain such insights, and the infrastructure--analytics, algorithms, registries, assessment scores, monitoring devices, and so forth--that organizations will need to perform the necessary analyses and to implement changes that will improve care while reducing costs. Our findings have policy implications for regulatory oversight, ways to address privacy concerns, and the support of research on analytics.

Creating value in health care through big data: opportunities and policy implications.

Joachim Roski, George W Bo-Linn, and Timothy A Andrews.

Big data has the potential to create significant value in health care by improving outcomes while lowering costs. Big data's defining features include the ability to handle massive data volume and variety at high velocity. New, flexible, and easily expandable information technology (IT) infrastructure, including so-called data lakes and cloud data storage and management solutions, make big-data analytics possible. However, most health IT systems still rely on data warehouse structures. Without the right IT infrastructure, analytic tools, visualization approaches, work flows, and interfaces, the insights provided by big data are likely to be limited. Big data's success in creating value in the health care sector may require changes in current polices to balance the potential societal benefits of big-data approaches and the protection of patients' confidentiality. Other policy implications of using big data are that many current practices and policies related to data use, access, sharing, privacy, and stewardship need to be revised.

Using Electronic Health Records for Surgical Quality Improvement in the Era of Big Data.

Jamie E Anderson and David C Chang.

Importance:Risk adjustment is an important component of quality assessment in surgical health care. However, data collection places an additional burden on physicians. There is also concern that outcomes can be gamed depending on the information recorded for each patient.

Objective:To determine whether a number of machine-collected data elements could perform as well as a traditional full-risk adjustment model that includes other physician-assessed and physician-recorded data elements.

Design, Settings, and Participants:All general surgery patients from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010, were included. Separate multivariate logistic regressions were performed using either all 66 preoperative risk variables or only 25 objective variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each regression using objective preoperative risk variables was compared with its corresponding regression with all preoperative variables. Subset analyses were performed among patients who received certain operations.

Main Outcomes and Measures:Mortality or any surgical complication captured by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, both inpatient and within 30 days postoperatively.

Results:Data from a total of 745 053 patients were included. More than 15.8% of patients had at least 1 complication and the mortality rate was 2.8%. When examining inpatient mortality, the AUC was 0.9104 with all 66 variables vs 0.8918 with all 25 objective variables. The difference in AUC comparing models with all variables with objective variables ranged from -0.0073 to 0.1944 for mortality and 0.0198 to 0.0687 for complications. In models predicting mortality, the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, pancreatic resection, colectomy, and appendectomy. In models predicting complications, the difference in AUC was less than 0.05 among all patients and subsets of patients with pancreatic resection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colectomy, and appendectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance:Rigorous risk-adjusted surgical quality assessment can be performed solely with objective variables. By leveraging data already routinely collected for patient care, this approach allows for wider adoption of quality assessment systems in health care. Identifying data elements that can be automatically collected can make future improvements to surgical outcomes and quality analyses.

 Association of Hospital Participation in a Quality Reporting Program With Surgical Outcomes and Expenditures for Medicare Beneficiaries.

Nicholas H Osborne, Lauren H Nicholas, Andrew M Ryan, Jyothi R Thumma, and Justin B Dimick.

Osborne and coauthors evaluate the association of enrollment and participation in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program with outcomes and Medicare payments compared with control hospitals that did not participate in the program.
