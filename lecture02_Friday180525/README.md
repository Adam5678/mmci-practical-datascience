The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis.usingAzure.md

David Lazer, Ryan Kennedy, Gary King, and Alessandro Vespignani.

In February 2013, Google Flu Trends (GFT) made headlines but not for a reason that Google executives or the creators of the flu tracking system would have hoped. Nature reported that GFT was predicting more than double the proportion of doctor visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which bases its estimates on surveillance reports from laboratories across the United States ( 1 , 2 ). This happened despite the fact that GFT was built to predict CDC reports. Given that GFT is often held up as an exemplary use of big data ( 3 , 4 ), what lessons can we draw from this error?

Machine Learning and the Profession of Medicine.

Alison M Darcy, Alan K Louie, and Laura Weiss Roberts.

This Viewpoint discusses the opportunities and ethical implications of using machine learning technologies, which can rapidly collect and learn from large amounts of personal data, to provide individalized patient care.

### Discussion Questions
1. Lazer *et. al.* talks about "big data hubris". When is data being "bigger" not necessarily better? What about the issue of transparency and reproducibility?
2. Darcy *et. al.* raises the issue of privacy. Are privacy and machine learning reconcilable?
