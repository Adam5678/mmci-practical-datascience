## Individual Assignment, DUE 3 August 2017. 

### Describe your Diabetes Readmission Prediction Model
Using Microsoft's Azure ML lab, you've built a prediction model for diabetes readmission. Please describe the rationale for your model and the decisions you made with building your model, and how you would intend for your model to be used in a health system setting. Please also describe potential pitfalls in the technical integration, deployment and use of your model.

So for **this 5-page assignment** have a section for each of the below:
1. *Rationale* for a Diabetes Readmission Model
2. *Describe the Data* you are using for the model
3. *Describe the Design Choices* for your model, e.g. what variable types and why you chose them, what algorithm did you choose, and why?
4. *How would you deploy your model in a health system?*, describe how you would integrate it into a health system like Duke. What difficulties would you anticipate, and how do you think you could address them?
5. *What kind of workflow, or user experience would you employ* to maximize the effectiveness of your model in a real world setting?
6. *What problems would you anticipate* in using your model in a real world setting?

This assignment must be submitted as a Word document, 1.5 line spacing. No PDFs. The title of the document must be "LastName-FirstName-MLAssignment".
