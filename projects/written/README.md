## Individual Assignment, 
### "If I were going to open source..."
Red Hat has a [good site for explaining "open source"](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), and has built a [robust business](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:RHT) out of developing and supporting open source software. As a company, they have demonstrated that they can deliver enterprise-grade operating systems and other software that are as reliable, secure, and stable as typical "closed source" products from their competitors. Yet their source code is open and people are free to use Red Hat products, without charge, however they like... And Red Hat can still be a $16B business.

Healthcare is a shared endeavor in our society. Players include the private sector as represented by private health systems, private insurers, Pharma, device manufacturers and vendors, and the public sector as represented by Federal insurance programs, Departments of Health, public hospitals, Federal research funding agencies. And then there are the patients, who often have to be their own advocates or work with patient advocacy organizations to represent their interests.

I would like you to think of a technology, a platform, a device (think Raspberry Pi) that you'd advocate for being open sourced.

A helpful list of considerations from OpenSource.com is [here](https://opensource.com/life/15/12/why-open-source).

So for **this 5-page assignment** please
1. Select what you'd like to open source
2. Describe its function in healthcare
3. Elaborate on Microeconomic motivations
4. Elaborate on Macroeconomic motivations
5. Discuss Moral motivations
6. Discuss Transparency motivations
7. Discuss Participatory motivations
8. Conclude with a sustainability plan, it can be a business model like Red Hat or an open source foundation model like the Apache software fooundation. Be creative! Think of other ways to support an open source technology in healthcare.
